= R4X

R4X is a pure-Ruby implementation of E4X.

== STATUS

This implementation follows the E4X specification to the letter.
At thei point it is only about half complete.

One difficulty with the implementation is that Ruby can not
support the exact syntax E4X designates, so an alternative
needs to be used --which has not yet been fully settled upon.
